        <h2>Reasoning behind project</h2>

        <p>While searching for a project topic, our group decided we wanted to walk away with something applicable to our average Middlebury student, but have some kind of impact beyond this project. We decided upon using a dataset created by former Sociology Professor Peggy Nelson for her research methods class up until 2020.</p>

        <p>The dataset contains 987 responses which although is small compared to other dataset, it is quite large compared to the Middlebury student population of 2580. The dataset itself is a survey of Middlebury students that asks a variety of social questions from relationship status to GPA. </p>
        <p>In addition to the data we got from the past survey, we also collected 60 responses as well from the current year that we could test our trees against as well.

        <p>Our goal was to create a fun algorithm that can predict the relationship status of Middlebury Students based on their response to a series of non-academic, social questions about preferences and beliefs at Middlebury.</p>

        <h2>Basic overview of how our code works</h2>

        <p>Our code is split into 3 parts: the main class, the Decision tree class, and the Random Forrest class. <br/>
        The Decision Tree class can build a tree, render a tree, and classify an observation based on a created tree</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
          <p> This is our Decision Tree Class </p>
            <pre><code>class DecisionTree: <br/> <br/>def __init__(self, features, classification, method, id):<br/>self.features = features<br/>self.classification = classification<br/>self.classifier = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion = method, min_samples_split = minSplit)<br/>self.numfeatures = np.random.randint(2, 17)<br/>self.featureslist = random.sample(range(17), self.numfeatures)<br/>self.usedfeatures = self.features.iloc[:, self.featureslist]<br/>self.id = id<br/><br/>def buildTree(self):<br/>if (self.id % 10 == 0):<br/>print("Building Tree #" + str(self.id))<br/><br/>self.featuresarray = self.usedfeatures.to_numpy()<br/>self.classifarray = self.classification.to_numpy()<br/>self.classifier.fit(self.featuresarray, self.classifarray)<br/><br/>def renderTree(self):<br/>tree.plot_tree(self.classifier)<br/>dot_data = tree.export_graphviz(self.classifier, out_file=None)<br/>graph = graphviz.Source(dot_data)<br/>graph.render(str(self.id))<br/><br/>def classifyTree(self, observation):<br/>usedobs = observation.iloc[:, self.featureslist]<br/>usedobsnp = usedobs.to_numpy()<br/>prediction = self.classifier.predict(usedobsnp)<br/>return prediction<br/>
            </code></pre>

        </ul> 

        <h2>Bugs and difficulties</h2>

         <dl>
          <dt>Getting used to python</dt>
          <dd>One of our initial difficulties was getting used to python and the python libraries that we had to use. These included python with sci-learn, numpy, pandas, graphviz, and matplotlib.</dd>
          <dt>Preprocessing Data</dt>
          <dd>Our data was not immediately usable so we had to figure out a way to make it into the right format</dd>
          <dt>Figuring out how sklearn and pandas</dt>
          <dd>We had some trouble halfway through the project with the way that sklearn and pandas handled data. Specifically, pandas worked with dataframes which are slightly different than other data structures that we are used to </dd>
