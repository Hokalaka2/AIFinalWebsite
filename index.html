        <p><em>View the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBR2TCfxEjODB6rnanns1hJPE4ViXXdfLoWQg86Gmlk/edit">project proposal</a>.</em></p>

        <h2>Reasoning behind project</h2>

        <p>While searching for a project topic, our group decided we wanted to walk away with something applicable to our average Middlebury student, but have some kind of impact beyond this project. We decided upon using a dataset created by former Sociology Professor Peggy Nelson for her research methods class up until 2020.</p>

        <p>The dataset contains 987 responses which is about 35% of the current total student body. The dataset itself is a survey of Middlebury students that asks a variety of social questions from relationship status to GPA. </p>

        <p>Our goal was to create a fun algorithm that can predict the relationship status of Middlebury Students based on their response to a series of non-academic, social questions about preferences and beliefs at Middlebury.</p>

        <h2>Basic overview of how our code works</h2>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Creating our decision tree</p>

            <pre><code>trainfeatures_dummy = pd.get_dummies(trainfeatures, columns = ['find_partner','gender','class','parents_married','race', 'housing', 'year'])<br/>featuresarray = trainfeatures_dummy.to_numpy() <br/>classifarray = trainclassification.to_numpy()<br/>classifier = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_split = 50)<br/>classifier.fit(featuresarray, classifarray)</code></pre>

          </li>
        </ol> 

        <h2>Bugs and difficulties</h2>

         <dl>
          <dt>Getting used to python</dt>
          <dd>One of our initial difficulties was getting used to python and the python libraries that we had to use. These included python with sci-learn, numpy, pandas, graphviz, and matplotlib.</dd>
          <dt>Preprocessing Data</dt>
          <dd>Our data was not immediately usable so we had to figure out a way to make it into the right format</dd>
        </dl>
