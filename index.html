        <h2>Reasoning behind project</h2>

        <p>While searching for a project topic, our group decided we wanted to walk away with something applicable to our average Middlebury student, but have some kind of impact beyond this project. We decided upon using a dataset created by former Sociology Professor Peggy Nelson for her research methods class up until 2020.</p>

        <p>Our goal was to create a fun algorithm that can predict the relationship status of Middlebury Students based on their response to a series of non-academic, social questions about preferences and beliefs at Middlebury.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Creating our decision tree</p>

            <pre><code>trainfeatures_dummy = pd.get_dummies(trainfeatures, columns = ['find_partner','gender','class','parents_married','race', 'housing', 'year'])<br/>featuresarray = trainfeatures_dummy.to_numpy() <br/>classifarray = trainclassification.to_numpy()<br/>classifier = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_split = 50)<br/>classifier.fit(featuresarray, classifarray)</code></pre>

          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Roses are red<br>
        Violets are blue</p>

        <p>The next paragraph has the same phrases, but now they are separated by two spaces and a newline character:</p>

        <p>Roses are red<br><br>
        Violets are blue</p>

        <p>Oh, and one thing I cannot stand is the mangling of words with multiple underscores in them like perform_complicated_task or do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.</p>

        <p>These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:</p>

        <h2>Math is hard, let's go shopping</h2>

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>
